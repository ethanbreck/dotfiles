# dotfiles

there are many `dotfiles`, but these are mine.

### installation

My `dotfiles` directory sits at `~/dotfiles`, each directory includes an relevant `install.sh` file, you can run all of them by running [`./setup`](/setup).

[redshift](/redshift/) and [bin](/bin/) have the most interesting things here.
